## Top Process Monitoring Plugin

The Top Process Monitor plugin enables
monitoring processes consuming the most CPU Time and/or Resident/WorkingSet memory and stores the process name as a dynamic measure.

Windows measures are collected through Powershell, so these measures must be executed from a Windows Collector.

Linux measures are collected through SSH, and can be collected from both Windows or Linux collectors.
